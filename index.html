            Muhammad Ali Sadpara was a Pakistani high-altitude mountaineer.
            Throughout his life, he successfully ascended a total eight
            mountains bigger than 8000 ft., four of which he climbed in a single
            calendar year. He began his career as a high-altitude bearer,
            serving as an assistant in mountain-climbing. In 2015, Sadpara's
            team attempted to climb Nanga Parbat (The Killer Mountain 8126m),
            but were unable to do so. Another attempt was made by the team in
            2016 and they successfully summit its peak, resulting in first ever
            winter climb of the peak. This achievement made him earn fame in
            Pakistan and around the globe.

            On 4th of February 2021, Muhammad Ali Sadpara along with his son
            Sajid Ali Sadpara, John Snorri and JP Mohr started their journey to
            climb the second highest peak K2 during the winter season. Sajid Ali
            Sadpara had to descend due to some technical issue but the other
            three continued their journey. Unfortunately, things did not go
            according to plan and the team lost their connection with the base
            camp and went missing. On February 5, a rescue mission started with
            the help of Pakistan Army, but no clue was found. On 26th of July,
            the dead body of Muhammad Ali Sadpara was found by his brave son
            Sajid Ali Sadpara who went on this mission. The entire nation was
            proud of Sajid's determination and bravery. The dead bodies of other
            mountaineers who went missing along with them were also discovered.
